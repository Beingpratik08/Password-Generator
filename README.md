# Password Generator App

A simple and customizable password generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to generate secure passwords by selecting different criteria such as length, character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and copy the generated password to the clipboard.

## Features

- **Customizable Password Length**: Adjust the length of the generated password using a range slider or numeric input.
- **Character Type Selection**: Choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Password Generation**: Click a button to generate a new password based on the selected criteria.
- **Clipboard Copy**: Copy the generated password to the clipboard with one click using the copy button.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:

   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser**:

## Usage

1. **Select the desired password length** using the range slider or by entering a number in the numeric input field.
2. **Choose the character types** for the password (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) by checking the corresponding checkboxes.
3. **Click "Generate Password"** to generate a new password based on the selected criteria.
4. **Click the "Copy" icon** to copy the generated password to your clipboard.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for the structure of the app.
- **CSS**: Styled the app for a clean and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: Handles password generation, user interactions, and clipboard functionality.

## How It Works

1. **Password Length**: The password length is customizable between 1 and 50 characters using a range slider or numeric input field.
2. **Character Types**: Depending on the user's selections, the password will include:
   - Uppercase letters (`A-Z`)
   - Lowercase letters (`a-z`)
   - Numbers (`0-9`)
   - Special symbols (`!@#$%^&*()_+[]{}|;:,.<>?`)
3. **Password Generation**: The password is randomly generated based on the selected length and character types. It is then displayed in an input field.
4. **Copy to Clipboard**: When the user clicks the "Copy" button, the generated password is copied to the clipboard.
